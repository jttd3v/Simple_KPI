# Simple KPI Operational Report

This project provides sample dashboards to present operational and crewing reports for a fleet. It contains a basic React dashboard as well as Tailwind based pages for data entry and viewing.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` to view the React demo dashboard.
3. Use `kowa_kpi_manning.html` to create or edit JSON data for the fleet.
4. Open `kowa_kpi_owner.html` and upload the generated JSON to view the dashboard.

## Files

- `index.html` – original React demo page
- `style.css` – simple styles for the demo page
- `app.js` – React components and example data
- `kowa_kpi_manning.html` – page to edit and download JSON data
- `kowa_kpi_owner.html` – dashboard that loads the JSON and displays reports

Feel free to extend the components or replace the sample data with real API calls as needed.
