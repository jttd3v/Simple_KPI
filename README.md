# Simple KPI Operational Report

This project provides a lightweight dashboard to present operational and crewing reports for a fleet. It uses plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript with a small set of sample data.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. No build step or dependencies are required.

## Files

- `index.html` – main HTML page
- `style.css` – styles for layout and readability
- `app.js` – JavaScript to render the report using sample data

Feel free to extend the scripts or replace the sample data with real API calls as needed.
