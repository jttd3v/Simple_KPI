# Simple KPI Operational Report

This project provides a basic React-based dashboard to present operational and crewing reports for a fleet. It uses a single HTML page with inline React components and a simple dataset for demonstration.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser. No build step is required because React is loaded from a CDN and the code is compiled in the browser using Babel.

## Files

- `index.html` – main HTML page linking all resources
- `style.css` – simple styles for layout
- `app.js` – React components and example data

Feel free to extend the components or replace the sample data with real API calls as needed.
